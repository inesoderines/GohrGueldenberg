More than 60 years after Martin Luther King's historic *I have a Dream* speech racism, racial hatred and unequal treatment still play an everyday role in the lives of African-American citizens. Arbitrary violence of white police officers again black people as well as dozens of deaths of unarmed African American citizens (such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner) have attracted the worldwide media attention in recent years (Desmond et al., 2016). In many cases, the perpetrators were not punished (GarcÃ­a & Sharif, 2015). The events led to the international protest movement *Black Lives Matter*, who demonstrate against racial inequality and white police violence (Carney, 2016). This awareness campaign aims to inform and increase the awareness on the topic by providing easily accessible information on racial disparities in the criminal justice system in the USA.

Since 2015, the *Washington Post* has collected data on deadly police shootings in the United States. On this basis, we first want to take a closer look at the number of unarmed victims during police shootings with regard to the subject race. 
The bar chart shows that in most states unarmed blacks and whites have been killed most often and almost with equal numbers. Additionally, California protrudes with extremely high numbers of deaths. To gain insights into possible racias bias, it is important to relate these results to the share of the ethnic group in the total population. 

### What is the racial composition of the United States? {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r echo=FALSE}

raceUS <- c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Other")

The pie chart shows that almost two-thirds of the US population consists of whites. By contrast, the African American population makes up a share of only 12.6% of the total population. The proportion of the Hispanic population lies at 16.9%. With reference to the previous page it can be concluded that in relative terms, more unarmed blacks than whites were killed in the US in 2015. This can be regarded as the first indication of a racial bias in the American police work.

Policemen carry out more than 50,000 traffic stops in the US every day. Despite this high number, there is no systematic record of traffic stops. In order to be able to statistically analyze differences in dealing with different ethnic groups, *Stanford University* journalists and data scientists launched the Stanford Open Policing Project in 2015. Using the data from this project, we aim to systematically examine possible racial biases in the US police system. 
For the *Stanford Open Policing Project*, more than 100 million records have been collected and standardized by state and local police departments on traffic stops across the country (Stanford Open Policing Project, 2015). In total, 31 states provided data for the project that were detailed enough to explore racial disparities. The remaining 19 states either had no electronic data collection or collected no information on the race. In addition, some states have not responded to the request, which is why there is no data from these states. The information on the data quality of each state is presented graphically in the form of a US-map.

In 2016, demonstrations against police violence and repeated riots, following the death of African American Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer occurred in Charlotte, NC. Because of these events, we want to take a look at the frequency at which the police in Charlotte stopped black, Hispanic and white drivers between 2004 and 2015.
 
The line chart shows that the African American population has been stopped more frequently than the white population at all times. The highest number of stops was in 2010 among African-American citizens, reaching 77594 traffic stops. Nevertheless, this result has to be treated with care since the stop rate itself is not meaningful enough to conclude a racial bias and we do not know what happened after the stop. Also, information about the racial composition is needed to guarantee undistorted results. Go on to the next page to learn more about the racial composition in Charlotte and further investigations on racial bias in US police work.

### What is the racial composition of Charlotte?

```{r echo=FALSE}

rrace <- c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Other")

The pie chart shows that whites represent the largest population group with 42.8%, closely followed by the African American population with 35.2%. Therefore, the higher number of traffic counts of the black population in Charlotte can preliminarily be explained by racial biases. But what is the general situation in America? Does this racism in the police work apply only to Charlotte, where a very high proportion of African Americans live? And what happens after the stop?

### Is American police work prone to racial bias? {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r echo=FALSE}
st <- combined_data %>% group_by(driver_race) %>% summarise(total =  mean(stop_rate, na.rm = T)) %>% arrange(-total) %>%

To check whether the nationwide police work differs from the previous result, the overall stop rate is now considered and tested with regard to a racial bias. The bar chart on the upper left shows that African American drivers are more than four times more likely to be stopped than white drivers. On average, Hispanics are stopped slightly more often than whites. Nevertheless, this outcome has to be viewed critically because there is no further information on what happened after the stop. What was the reason for the stop? Was the stop justified? Was the driver searched for contraband (drugs, weapons etc.) and if yes, was contraband found? Thus, it cannot be said with certainty that racial bias is the reason for high number of the police stops for the black population. Therefore, different variables will be inspected in the other three bar charts. 

To further inspect if a police stop was conducted due to racial bias, it is necessary to explore whether African American and Hispanic drivers are also searched with a higher probability than whites after being stopped. The bar chart on the top right indicates that African American drivers were searched with the highest probability. Nevertheless, Hispanics are almost as likely to be searched for contraband as African American drivers. In comparison, white drivers are only half as likely to be searched. But does that also mean that black and Hispanic drivers are searched on the basis of less evidence than white drivers?

In spite of this all, we are still lacking information if the stop was justified or not. Did the police find e.g. drugs or weapons? If black and Hispanic drivers also happen to carry contraband at higher rates, the higher search rates may stem from appropriate police work and there would be no racial bias. Accordingly, the task to differ discrimination from effective police work is highly challenging and therefore a closer look on the hit rate will be conducted in a next step. The bar chart on the bottom left examines the hit rate and thus provides information on if contraband was found in the search. One can conclude that although black and Hispanic drivers were stopped and searched more frequently, contraband has not been found quite as often. White drivers are searched less often but are more likely to be found with contraband. This outcome indicates that African American and Hispanic Americans are stopped with less evidence of wrongdoing. Even though we cannot conclude with certainty that police officers knowingly engaged in racial discrimination, the outcome indicates that search decisions may be biased against not only black, but also Hispanic drivers and race plays a role for stops made by American police officers.

Before having a closer look on the incarceration trends and a possible racial bias in the criminal justice system in the US, it is interesting to examine the arrest rates that were conducted by police officers. The fourth bar chart âArrest rate in %â on the bottom left shows that Hispanic drivers are arrested most often, followed by African American driver. White drivers are only half as likely to be arrested as Hispanics. 


### Does urbanicity play a role for the incarceration rate for different races? {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r}

prison_summary %>% 
  filter(pop_category %in% c("White", "Black", "Latino")) -> prison_tmp

prison_tmp$pop_category <- as.factor(prison_tmp$pop_category)

prison_tmp$pop_category %>% 
  plyr::revalue(c("Latino" = "Hispanic")) -> prison_tmp$pop_category

pr <- prison_tmp %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, rate_per_100000, color = urbanicity)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("U.S. Incarceration Trends from 1995 - 2015") +
  ylim(100, 2800) +
  facet_wrap(~ pop_category, nrow = 1, scales = "fixed") +
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Incarceration Rate per 100.000",
       color = "Urbanicity") +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  xlim(1995, 2015) +
  theme(panel.spacing = unit(0.9, "lines"))

In addition to the American police system, the penal system might also be affected by racism and discrimination. According to the *Vera Institute of Justice*, African Americans are imprisoned with a 3.6 times higher probability than whites (Vera Institute of Justice, 2015). The *Incarceration Trends* dataset, issued by the Vera Institute of Justice (2015), contains data from the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice as well as from state departments of correction. In this section, we aim to investigate systematically if African Americans are actually being detained more often than whites. Also, we want to know if urbanity plays a key role in the incarceration trends to gain further insights into possible causes.

Using the *Vera Institute of Justiceâs* Incarceration Trend data tool, we found that black people continue to be vastly overrepresented in US jails. Nevertheless, the data evinces decreasing numbers in incarceration rates for black people since 2005 while white incarceration rates have steadily grown since the late 90s. The root causes of these diverging trends are not clear but currently subject of investigation of *Vera Institute*. Furthermore, the line chart emphasizes that the incarceration rates vary strongly between the races and are highest for the African American population in the US. The urbanity does not seem to play a significant role since they show similar results for rural, small/mid, suburban as well as urban areas. Only the suburban African American population shows lower incarcerations rates but is still significantly higher than for other ethnicities.

Note: The incarceration rate depicts the number of people in jail for every 100.000 people aged 15 to 64 in the respective county. 

### Which conclusion can be drawn? Where can you find further information and data? {data-commentary-width=650}

More than 20 million Americans are stopped for traffic violations each year. Thus, police stops are one of the most common ways in which police and public interact with each other. We found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers is lower than for searching whites as well as imbalances in the incarceration rates, stop rates and arrest rates. Thus, our findings indicate evidence of widespread discrimination in police work and penitentiary across the USA. 

Since the police departments have collected only partly incomplete information on traffic stops, we recommend all local police stations to gather the following data on a systematical basis: time and place of a stop, race and sex of the driver, stop reason, information on whether a search was carried out, whether contraband was found and if an arrest was made. Thereby, further detailed analyzes can be carried out and the own police work could be checked individually for a racial bias through every police department. If it turns out that racist tendencies have an impact on police work, targeted training should be provided. In addition, we recommend to sensitize prospective police officers and lawyers during their studies in order to stem racist influences on the justice system from the beginning.

We sincerely thank you for your attention and hope that we have raised your interest and awareness on the topic. Below we have collected links for additional information.
